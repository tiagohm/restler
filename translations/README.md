## How to translate

### Steps:

* Fork this project. (Click on Fork in the upper right)
* [Clone your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/).

 * Translate the strings using the file `en_US.json` as the reference. To do that, you can open an existing file or create a new file within of this directory. The name of the file must follow this format: `language_REGION.json` (e.g. `en_US.json`, `pt_BR.json`, `ja_JA.json`), **"language" must be lowercase and "region" must be uppercase**.
 * After you're satisfied with your work,  commit and push into your project.
 * [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

Alternatively, you can send me an email (tiago.henrique.cco@gmail.com) with the translated files.
